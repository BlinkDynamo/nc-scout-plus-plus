"\n" \
"<OPTIONS>:\n" \
"  -h, --help       Show this help message.\n" \
"  -f, --full-path  Display the discovered files/directories as full-paths.\n" \
"  -m, --matches    Display matches to the convention instead of non-matches.\n" \

"  The default enforcement of naming conventions for a search is lenient, although, using\n" \
"  the -s or --strict option, you can strictly enforce the naming convention for that search.\n" \

"  Strict enforcement means that the naming convention MUST be present in it's entirety, while\n" \

"    Matches strictly:\n" \
"      flatcase - Exactly matches the convention in it's entirety\n" \
"\n" \
"    Matches leniently:\n" \
"      kebabcase - Could be extended to example-file.txt to match the convention in it's entirety\n" \
